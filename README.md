# Data-Set-Retriever
Mini side project/web application that searches and retrieves data sets using the world bank's development survey api. I created this tool to familiarize myself with Vue and to help extend my undergraduate research into mobile money in Kenya.

Project is hosted on GitHub Pages: https://chrism6475.github.io/Data-Set-Retriever/src
